            <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>My name is Terry Shim, and I am a current sophomore at Stevens Institute of Technology. I major in computer science 
                    with a passion for web development and problem solving. Growing up as a Korean-American, I grew in love with both cultures, however, I lost 
                    touch with my Korean roots and have relearned the beauty of my heritage. Therefore, I am also a member of KSA at Stevens. In my free time I love to hang out with my friends and family members.
                    I've been in New Jersey all my life and could not imagine living anywhere else, but I do want to travel the world both inside and outside
                    the country.
