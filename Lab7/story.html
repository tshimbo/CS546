      <h1> A Story About Spring Break</h1>
      <main>
        <p>Tuesday, March 14 at approximately 10:00 a.m. my best friend and I drove to Boston with my best friend for the week.
          Within the drive we stopped only once for gas, and with the gas prices at an all time high we nearly did not make it to our destination.
          As we arrived we met with my girlfriend at Boston University. Our first battle was fighting the drivers along the mean streets of Boston 
          as the drivers assume they have a sense of invulnerability within the roads. However driving in a Beige 2009 Toyota Camry does not
          qualify for a similar mindset. The first stop was meeting the classmates of my girlfriend, who began with insults about my best friend's parking.
          Resisting the urge to fight, we quickly cleaned the car and made room for my girlfriend to sit in the back of the car. 
        </p>
        <p>Within this week we explored the world of concerts, clubs, restaurants, and other universities in the heart of Boston. One of the restaurants that we visited
          was Time Out Market, which provided a pretentious quantity of shrimp scampi that felt as if they were serving rations for the small price of $18. Unfortunately, my bank
          account was not ready for such a hit. The next day my friend and I separated from the group and met with another friend to explore the World's Smallest Trader Joe's. Unfortunately, they did not have 
          the flowers that I was looking for. Luckily enough, there was another flower shop in which these fascinating Galaxy Orchids were offered. 
        </p>
        <p> After a long rest in the morning we had lunch in the dining hall and I decided to eat everything I could since it was free. We then packed up all of our stuff and prepared for the
            four hour drive that awaited us.
            We have now come back to our respective schools and long for this feeling again.
